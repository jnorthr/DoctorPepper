== Purpose

This is an open-source tool to continuously translate any asciidoctor file that is changed within a defined folder.

== DropBox or Google Drive Enabled ?

This trick works nicely if you have a shared drive service like *Dropbox*, or *Google Drive* etc. and all your internal systems use the same *Dropbox*,etc. account.

I have six systems in my place. All of them hooked to same remote drive account. This way i can work on any of my internal systems and
still use/keep documentation and code safely and visibly on *all* my systems.

On one of my least-used systems, did the following:

.Gradle Continuous Doctor Translation
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/Dropbox
git clone https://github.com/jnorthr/DoctorPepper.git
cd ~/Dropbox/DoctorPepper
gradlew -t asciidoctor
----

The *-t* option keeps gradle running in continuous mode so now any changes i make to any asciidoctor files are near-instantly
translated for me.


NOTE: If you don't have a *git* client https://git-scm.com/downloads[click here to install one]

''''

== Update from A Different System

Went to a second system in my place. Updated this *Dropbox/DoctorPepper/src/docs/asciidoc/sample.adoc* file with:

More stuff here. Did this `sample.html` update from another machine show up on my *Dropbox* account?

Will a new *sample.html* show up on this machine too ?

''''

IMPORTANT: NO ! Why not ? Because screen saver on my gradle system put it to sleep !

''''

== Don't Allow Sleeping on The Job

If the server or desktop running your `gradlew -t asciidoctor` continuous process has it's screen saver
turned on, then you will only have continuous doctor translation while it does not sleep.

With full-time running, my asciidoctor translation process will nicely convert any/every change i make to my *.adoc*,etc.
 documents within the *src/docs/asciidoc* folder. 

''''

== Goal

What does this achieve ? Well anywhere on any of my six systems, i can modify my documentation and the _kind-of_
remote server will produce a new `*.html* set of results. Then i can have one or several browsers viewing the
results of files i'm editing, say in folder *DoctorPepper/build/docs* for my revised *sample.html*.

While doing this page, i had my text editor open, fixed some spelling mistakes and only did an editor save, like *Ctrl-S*
and toggled over to my window with the browser open to this *sample.html* page and did a browser re-fresh! *Bang!*

NOTE: Near-instant Translation

Then i only click browser refresh to see the new view and this saves me the bother of copying 
everything up to my CloudFoundry target. *Nice ;-)*

TIP: Just copying new *.adoc* files into *src/docs/asciidoc* will appear in the output folder too !

''''

== Table of Contents / Summary Page

While working on this tool, decided to write some groovy to generate an asciidoctor file named *toc.adoc* and
this is written into the same folder that the asciidoctor task is watching. The next time this task runs, the *toc.adoc*
is magically turned into an *toc.html* page with links to every `*.html` within the watched folder or sub-folders.

IMPORTANT: Surprise !

Was *surprised* when i accidentally ran *groovydoc* task to produce some API doc.s for my `Walker.groovy` code, and low-and-behold
the next cycle of our *asciidoctor* task included all my *groovydoc*, *javadoc*, and test reports in this *toc.adoc* summary !

=== Even More

Since i've added http://rants.broonix.ca/java-code-coverage-with-gradle-and-jacoco-2/[*Jacoco*] code coverage tool, to see a full-blown example of `walker` in action try this:

.Generate a Bunch of HTML, Writing Table of Contents for It and Convert to HTML 
[source,bash]
----
gradlew build  jacocoTestReport groovydoc test walker asciidoctor
----

After this, there should be a fully-loaded `/Users/jimnorthrop/Dropbox/Projects/DoctorPepper/build/docs/toc.html`

=== `Walker` Task in Gradle

Several ways can be used to execute *Walker*. To cause the automatic generation of a _table of contents_, have included a
`walker` task. Run it using *gradle* like this: 

.Generating a Table Of Contents as a One-Time Event
[source,bash]
----
gradlew walker
----

*- or -*

We can generate a _Table Of Contents_ as a step after the `asciidoctor` task completes

.Continuous Running
[source,bash]
----
gradlew -t asciidoctor walker
----

TIP: Change gradle's `defaultTasks` to do both tasks in continuous mode.

''''

In continuous mode, gradle notices the arrival of *toc.adoc* in the `DoctorPepper/src/docs/asciidoc` folder and converts it to *HTML*.
This approach causes a tight-loop as each time `asiidoctor` ran followed by `walker`, then `walker` would produce a new *toc.adoc* which
then caused `asciidoctor` to run, which caused ...

So added some timimg logic in `walker` to only produce a new *toc.adoc* file if 1) it's missing or 2) it is older than about 50 seconds.

''''

== PDF Generation

As it was so easy to do, have caused the `asciidoctor` task to produce a *PDF* file for each *.html* file generated. To improve performance
or if *PDF* files are not needed, change the closure in *gradle* like this: 

.Asciidoctor Closure in Gradle
[source,gradle]
----
  backends = ['html5','pdf']	// if you don't want PDFs delete 'pdf'
----  

WARNING: Enjoy *;-D*
