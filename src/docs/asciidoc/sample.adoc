== DropBox or Google Drive Enabled ?

This trick works nicely if you have a shared drive service like *Dropbox*, etc. and all your internal systems use the same *Dropbox*,etc. account.

I have six systems in my place. All of them hooked to same remote drive account. This way i can work on any of my internal systems and
still use/keep documentation and code safely and visibly on *all* my systems.

On one of my least-used systems, did a *cd* into the root of this folder, then ran the following:

.gradle continuous doctor translation
[source,bash]
----
gradle -t asciidoctor
----

== Update from A Different System

Wen
More stuff here. Did this `sample.html` update from another machine on my Dropbox account?

Will a new sample.html show up on this machine too ?

IMPORTANT: NO ! Why not ? Because screen saver on my gradle system put it to sleep !

== Don't Allow Sleeping on The Job

If the server or desktop running your `gradle -t asciidoctor` continuous process has it's screen saver
turned on, then you will only have a continuous doctor translation while it does not sleep.

With full-time running, my asciidoctor tranlation process will nicely convert any/every change i make to my *.adoc*,etc.
 documents within the *src/docs/asciidoc* folder. 

== Goal

What does this achieve ? Well anywhere on any of my six systems, i can modify my documentation and the _kind-of_
remote server will produce a new `*.html* set of result. Then i can have one or several browsers viewing the
results, say in folder `Asciidoctor/build/docs` for my revised *sample.html*.

While doing this page, i had my text editor open, fixed some spelling mistakes and only did an editor save, like *Ctrl-S*
and toggled over to my window with the browser open to the results page and did a browser re-fresh! *Bang!*

Then i only click browser refresh to see the new view and this saves me the bother of copying 
everything up to my CloudFoundry target. *Nice ;-)*
