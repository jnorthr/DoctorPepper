== DropBox or Google Drive Enabled ?

This trick works nicely if you have a shared drive service like *Dropbox*, or *Google Drive* etc. and all your internal systems use the same *Dropbox*,etc. account.

I have six systems in my place. All of them hooked to same remote drive account. This way i can work on any of my internal systems and
still use/keep documentation and code safely and visibly on *all* my systems.

On one of my least-used systems, did the following:

.Gradle Continuous Doctor Translation
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/Dropbox
git clone https://github.com/jnorthr/DoctorPepper.git
cd ~/Dropbox/DoctorPepper
gradlew -t asciidoctor
----

The *-t* option keeps gradle running in continuous mode so now any changes i make to any asciidoctor files are near-instantly
translated for me.

''''

== Update from A Different System

Went to a second system in my place. Updated this *Dropbox/DoctorPepper/src/docs/asciidoc/sample.adoc* file with:

More stuff here. Did this `sample.html` update from another machine show up on my *Dropbox* account?

Will a new *sample.html* show up on this machine too ?

''''

IMPORTANT: NO ! Why not ? Because screen saver on my gradle system put it to sleep !

''''

== Don't Allow Sleeping on The Job

If the server or desktop running your `gradlew -t asciidoctor` continuous process has it's screen saver
turned on, then you will only have continuous doctor translation while it does not sleep.

With full-time running, my asciidoctor translation process will nicely convert any/every change i make to my *.adoc*,etc.
 documents within the *src/docs/asciidoc* folder. 

''''

== Goal

What does this achieve ? Well anywhere on any of my six systems, i can modify my documentation and the _kind-of_
remote server will produce a new `*.html* set of results. Then i can have one or several browsers viewing the
results of files i'm editing, say in folder *DoctorPepper/build/docs* for my revised *sample.html*.

While doing this page, i had my text editor open, fixed some spelling mistakes and only did an editor save, like *Ctrl-S*
and toggled over to my window with the browser open to this *sample.html* page and did a browser re-fresh! *Bang!*

NOTE: Near-instant Translation

Then i only click browser refresh to see the new view and this saves me the bother of copying 
everything up to my CloudFoundry target. *Nice ;-)*

TIP: Just copying new *.adoc* files into *src/docs/asciidoc* will appear in the output folder too !

IMPORTANT: Enjoy ;-D
